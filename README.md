# Rubik's cube solver
### Android app that solves the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube.
It scans the faces using OpenCV, then it solves the cube in less than 26 moves (with Kociemba's algorithm), and lastly it shows the calculated moves in a 3D reproduction of the cube. 
It's possible to see each move and spin the cube.

The app was made for a university project (Object Oriented Programming course).
### Cube requirements 
The app only works with a 3x3x3 cube, with colors red, blue, green, orange, yellow and white.

## Contributions
This was a team project made by [Daniele Napolitano](https://github.com/danielenapo) and [Niccolò Serafino](https://github.com/serafinon). The work was divided in two parts:
* Daniele -> Cube scanning
* Niccolò -> 3D Moves visualization

## Design
This app was used to make a documentation of design and architecture for another university project (Software Engineering course).

You can read the PDF in this [link](https://github.com/danielenapo/Rubik-s-cube-solver/blob/master/Design.pdf) (in Italian). <br>
